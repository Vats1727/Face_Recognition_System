# Face_Recognition_System
It is aFace Recognition System Based on Python.

*Working*
•	These project is dvided into two part, the first part will collect 100 sample data images.
•	These sample data images are collected in gray contrast.
•	The second part of project will scan live face with webcam. Or any other connected camera devices.
•	It will recognize live face and compare it with to collected sample data images .
•	I have used Pycharm IDE for these project.
•	The Library used in these project are OpenCV and numpy.
•	OpenCV is used for recognition of face and verify the alignment of face and it will compare it with sample data images
•	In addition to it I have given a condition of percentage that means if live face is verified to certain percentage(eg:- face>=80%) then it will print “Unlocked” and if  it is less then 80% it will print “Locked”.
•	As we discuss above if face matches then it will print Unlock on screen.
•	But  now after updating the project it will open a chat website if face matches to sample data images.
•	It means it will give an access to the website if face matches.
•	That means project will work as real time security system.
•	We can use Python base IDE like Pycharm or
•	    Visual Studio Code.
•	I have used Pycharm IDE for these project.
•	The Library used in these project are OpenCV and numpy.
•	OpenCV is used for recognition of face and verify the alignment of face and it will compare it with sample data images.
•	Numpy is used for counting of data sample collected.
